                                        PLOT3D Exporter add-on enables the
                                        use of the most commonly available visu-

                            based and user-developed GUIs.</p><p> The
                            add-on also enables the use of Tecplot as
                            an interpolation tool for solution conver-
                            sion between different grids of different
                            types. This one add-on enhances the
                            functionality of Tecplot so significantly, it
                            offers the ability to incorporate Tecplot
                            into a general suite of tools for computa-
                            tional science applications as a 3D graph-
                            ics engine for visualization of all data.</p><p>
                            Within the PLOT3D Export Add-on
                            are several functions that enhance the
                            operations and effectiveness of the add-
                            on. Unlike Tecplot output functions,
                            the PLOT3D Export Add-on enables
                            the use of the zone selection dialog in
                            Tecplot to choose which zones are to be
                            written by offering three distinct op-
                            tions â€” output of active, inactive, or all
                            zones (grid blocks). As the user modi-
                            fies the zones to output with the zone
                            selection dialog, the zones to be written
                            are similarly updated. This enables the
                            use of Tecplot to create multiple config-
                            urations of a geometry being analyzed.</p><p>
                            For example, if an aircraft is loaded
                            with multiple deflections of flaps, by ac-
                            tivating and deactivating different
                            zones for a specific flap setting, new
                            specific configurations of that aircraft
                            can be easily generated by only writing
                            out specific zones. Thus, if ten flap set-
                            tings are loaded into Tecplot, the
                            PLOT3D Export software can output
                            ten different configurations, one for
                            each flap setting.</p>
